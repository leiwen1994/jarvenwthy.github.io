            You are the sun that shines brightly throughout my day.
            You are the gravity that holds me down in every way.
            You are the moon that shimmers throughout my night.
            You are stars that glimmer oh so bright.
            You are the oxygen that keeps me alive.
            You are my heart that beats inside.
            You are the blood that flows through me.
            You are the only guy I can see.
            You have the voice of when a mockingbird sings.
            You are my everything.
